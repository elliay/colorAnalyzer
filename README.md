This application allows users to gather and learn about the colors from the world around them. Users upload an image that they want to analyze, and the application 
returns the image with bounding boxes drawn where the dominant colors are located, along with the rgb values of these dominant colors so that the user can learn more about the colors.

Based on the starter code from that video, I wrote the rest of the code with some help from ChatGPT for the parts I didn't know how to do on my own, like the KMeans clustering and the OpenCV stuff.
